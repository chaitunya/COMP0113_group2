To clone the project, first install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/), then `git clone` the repository. Open the scene at Assets/UI/UI.unity.

The code for the wardrobe UI is in Assets/avatar-example/UI/Script. The code for the Pen is in Assets/avatar-example/Pen. Additionally, we added HatAvatar.cs and ItemAvatar.cs to Assets/avatar-example for adding hats and handheld items to the avatar and modified TexturedAvatar.cs and FloatingAvatar.cs in the same directory.
